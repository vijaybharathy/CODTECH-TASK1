**OBJECTIVE**

Develop a comprehensive e-commerce website or mobile application thatenables users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases.

**Technologies Used:**

**HTML**: For the structure of the page (header, products, cart, etc.).

**CSS**: For styling the page, making it visually appealing and responsive.

**JavaScript**: For handling dynamic actions like adding products to the cart, updating the cart count, and displaying the total price.

**Key Features**:

•Simple product listing.

•Interactive cart with dynamic updates.

•Basic checkout functionality (just an alert for now).

This is a basic e-commerce website where users can browse a collection of products and add them to their cart. Here’s a simple breakdown of the project:

**Header Section:**

Displays the store name ("My Store").
Includes a cart button that shows how many items are in the cart.

**Main Section (Product List):**

Displays 4 products, each with:
An image.
A name.
A price.
A button to add the product to the cart.
The products are displayed horizontally and can be scrolled if needed.

**Cart Section:**

Displays the items added to the cart.
Shows the total price of the items in the cart.
Provides a "Proceed to Checkout" button, which alerts the user to proceed with the checkout process (though no actual payment system is implemented).

**Footer:**

Contains the copyright information.

**Functionality:**

Add to Cart: When a user clicks "Add to Cart," the product is added to the cart (stored in a JavaScript array).
Update Cart: The cart is updated to reflect the number of items and the total price.
View Cart: Clicking the "Cart" button shows a modal with the list of items in the cart and the total.
Checkout: The user can click "Proceed to Checkout," which currently shows a simple alert indicating that they can proceed.

**Conclusion:**

This project is a simple, static e-commerce website with basic features to simulate adding items to a cart, updating the cart, and proceeding to checkout. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity.
